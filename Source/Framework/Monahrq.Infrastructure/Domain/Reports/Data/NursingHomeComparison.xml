    <![CDATA[<p><strong>How to interpret content</strong>
    <br>Each rating in the report is shown as a simple image along with a word or two. The words will tell you how a particular nursing home compares to the average rating of the other homes in the area. Going from best to worst, the rating will show that a nursing home is:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><span class="rating-nursing">
  <img width="155" height="24" src="themes/base/assets/stars_5.png" class=""><br>
  <span class="rating-nursing--title ng-binding">Much better than average</span>

    </ul>
    <br><strong>The information on this website comes from two sources:</strong>
    <br>1. Yearly health and safety inspections of each nursing home that are done by state agencies. Health and safety information, and staffing information, come from reports on these inspections.
    <br>2. Monthly information that each nursing home submits to the federal government about each resident. Quality information comes from this information source.
    <br>
    <br><strong>What’s here?</strong>
    <br>There are three types of information in this Report:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Information</strong>, such as whether residents are receiving appropriate care what is happening to their health and ability to function</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Safety Information</strong>, such as number of health and safety problems found when state agencies did an inspection</li>
        <li><strong>Staffing Information</strong>, such as the number of nursing home staff available to care for residents during their stay</li>
    </ul>
    <br>This information helps you compare nursing homes to each other and see which are better. You can compare up to 5 nursing homes in terms of their Overall Score, their Inspection Score, their Quality Score and their Staffing Score.
    <br>
    <br><strong>How can I use this information?</strong>
    <br>You can use this information to:
    <ul>
        <li>help you choose a nursing home for yourself</li>
        <li>provide useful information for your loved ones if they need nursing home care</li>
        <li>encourage nursing homes to improve their quality</li>
    </ul>
