	<p>Information is provided for each selected region by condition or procedure grouping. Select the titles in the top row to sort the results. Tables may include the following:<br/><br/><b>Total US</b>: National numbers are weighted estimates from the <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/" target="_blank">HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample</a> (NIS), 2011, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).<br/><br/><b>Total US region</b>: Regional categories are defined by the Census Bureau: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West. Numbers for each region are weighted estimates from the <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/" target="_blank">HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample</a> (NIS), 2011, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).<br/><br/><b>Total of all counties in this Website</b>: Numbers are presented for all counties included in this Website.<br/><br/><b>Counties</b>: Previously chosen counties are listed. You can select a specific region for more detailed results. Detailed results include characteristics for each region (age, gender, payer, and race).<br/><br/><b>Number of discharges</b>: The number of hospital stays (or discharges) for the selected condition or procedure is provided for each region.<br/><br/><b>Rate of discharges</b>: The number of hospital stays (or discharges) divided by the number of residents in the region. region resident or population numbers are obtained from the US Census Bureau.<br/><br/><b>Mean costs in dollars</b>: The mean or average cost is sometimes reported for each region. Costs are the actual value of these services (while charges are what a hospital asks to be paid for services). Total charges were converted to costs using <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/costtocharge.jsp" target="_blank">cost-to-charge ratios</a> based on hospital accounting reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In general, costs are less than charges.  AHRQ adjusts the <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/costtocharge.jsp" target="_blank">cost-to-charge ratios</a> to work with this type of hospital data.</p>	<p>If you select a specific region you will get following:<br/><br/><b>Age group</b>: Patient age in years is based on the admission date to the hospital and date of birth. The number of stays in each age group is reported.<br/><br/><b>Gender</b>: The number of males and females is reported for the selected region and condition or procedure.<br/><br/><b>Race</b>: Race/ethnicity of the patient as listed in the medical record. Racial and ethnic categories are collapsed into larger groups based on US Census Bureau designations.<br/><br/>You may notice some special codes in the tables:<br/><br/><b>Not enough data</b>: When there are not enough data to report a value, a dash appears.<br/><br/><b>Small number suppression</b>: Small raw numbers may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality. In this case, a &quot;c&quot; appears.</p>]]>
