		<![CDATA[<p> An avoidable hospital stay is one that might have been avoided with better medical care outside of the hospital. For example, a diabetes patient who receives good care from her primary care physician might not need a hospital stay for diabetes complications. Hospital stays like these are not always avoidable, but they are potentially avoidable with good quality health care.

		<![CDATA[<p> *Cost savings are based on charges that have been adjusted to costs, using hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios.<br/>Values based on 10(numerator suppression value) or fewer discharges are suppressed to protect confidentiality of patients and are designated with a "c".

		<![CDATA[<p>How do I interpret this table?<P>
	 <p>This table presents data on a selected quality indicator by county.<br/><br/><b>Numerator:</b> The number of hospital stays for county residents for whom the event or outcome of interest occurred (e.g., death caused by heart attack).<br/><br/><b>Denominator:</b> The number of county residents based on US Census Bureau data.  <br/><br/><b>Observed rate:</b> The numerator divided by the denominator. This rate is unadjusted.<br/><br/><b>Risk adjusted rate:</b> Risk-adjustment is a statistical process that adjusts a hospital\&#146;s estimated performance if the hospital had an &quot;average&quot; case mix.  Risk adjustment is performed as in AHRQ\&#146;s Quality Indicator software for Window.  For indicators that are not risk adjusted, a dash (&quot;-&quot;) appears.<br/><br/><b>10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%:</b> The amount displayed reflects the cost savings result of the identified percentage reduction in the number of avoidable stays for all hospitals in a county for the conditions (multiple) selected.<br /><br /></p>]]>
