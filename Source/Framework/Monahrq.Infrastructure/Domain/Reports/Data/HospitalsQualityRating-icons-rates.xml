		<![CDATA[<P>What are hospital quality ratings?<P>		
	<p>There are many ways to judge the quality of health care.  Health care quality can be described as doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right way -- and having the best possible results.<br/><br/>Quality ratings are based on specific quality indicators.  A quality indicator is a piece of information, usually a number, that shows how often patients had a particular experience when they received medical care. These experiences reflect a particular aspect of hospital quality.  This report uses three different types of quality indicators.<br/><br/><a class="local-link" href="#/resources/AboutQualityRatings" >Learn more about health care quality ratings.</a><br/><br/><a href="#/resources/Methods" >Learn more about hospital quality.</a></p>
