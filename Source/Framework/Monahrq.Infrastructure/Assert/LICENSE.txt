Code under this namespace is taken from TheHelperTrinity library by 
Kent Boogaart (https://github.com/kentcb/TheHelperTrinity).

Modifications include, but are not limited to:
 * Namespace change (from HelperTrinity to Monahrq.Infrastructure.Assert)
 * ArgumentHelper.AssertEnumMember (changed behavior)
 * EventHelper.BeginRaise (new overload)

If these differences can be abstracted or eliminated, the included code
should be removed and replaced with TheHelperTrinity library from nuget
