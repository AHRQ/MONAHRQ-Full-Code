BindToExtension
	- This acts as a wrapper for the markup "Binding".
	- Adds a new, (simpler) format for defining bindings.  Bindings are now entered by a single string.
		Binding Type		Denote					Example Text						Comment
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Property			<no change>				<BindTo "Document">					Binds to a property Document on current DataSource.
													<BindTo "xxx.Document">				Binds to a property Document on 'xxx'.
		Element				# at start				<BindTo "#MyControl">				Binds to a control with Name="MyControl"
		Ancestor Control	ancestor(s) at start	<BindTo "ancestor.Type>				Binds to 1st ancestor control of type "Type".
													<BindTo "ancestors.Type">
		This Window			thiswindow at start		<BindTo "thiswindow">				Binds to the root Window.  Same as Ancestor.Window.
		CodeBehind View		root at start			<BindTo "root">						Binds to the view class (codebehind) itself.
		Self				this at start			<BindTo "this">						Does a RelativeSource=Self binding.
		Template			template at start		<BindTo "template">					Does a RelativeSource=TemplateParent binding.
													<BindTo "templateparent">
													<BindTo "templatedParent">
		C# Function			() at end				<BindTo	"OnSomeAction()">			Binds to a function on DataSource.  Behind the scenes, it creates a proxy ICommand, thus must be bound where ICommand can be used.  (Not where event/func is used)
													<BindTo "root.OnSomeAction()>		Binds to a function on View (Code behind).
		
		*** Binding keyword matches are matched via .ToLower(), so casing doesn't matter for keywords. 

	- Converter option to forward this to the underlying Binding.Converter.
	- SoureceReference option
		- Relative - (default value) - Mainly uses the VisualTree for searching for bind.
		- Absolute - Does no use the VisualTree to find binding object.  Useful for binding where enclosing element not part of a VisualTree. (Only works with bindings that stem from Element and View[CodeBehind] (?and Template?) bindings)
