  <h2>Overall Rating</h2>
  <section>
  This is the weighted total of selected scores on health inspections, quality measures, and staffing measures. This rate is available if compared at the national level. MONAHRQ doesn’t report overall rating at the peer/state and county level.

  <h2>Overall Inspection Results</h2>
  <section>
    <p>This data is based on the results of the three most recent annual and complaint-related health inspection surveys. Scores are calculated based on the number, scope, and severity of minimum standards that are not met and the number of revisits needed to confirm compliance.  Stars are assigned based on performance within a State - for instance, only the top ten percent of performers in a State receive a five star rating.</p>
