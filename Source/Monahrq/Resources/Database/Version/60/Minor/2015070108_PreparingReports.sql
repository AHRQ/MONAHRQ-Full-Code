For more information on which statistics are available for each indicator, visit the &lt;a class="local-link" href="#/resources/AboutQualityRatings" &gt;Measure Details&lt;/a&gt; page. Numbers in the measure details table are not scaled.  These are raw statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Numerator: &lt;/b&gt;The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest occurs (e.g., death caused by heart attack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Denominator: &lt;/b&gt;The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest might potentially occur (e.g., admitted to the hospital for heart attack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observed rate: &lt;/b&gt;The numerator divided by the denominator. This rate is unadjusted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected rate: &lt;/b&gt;The rate the hospital would have if it performed the same as the reference population given the hospital\&amp;#146;s actual case mix. In other words, the expected rate adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, DRG, and comorbidity categories) among patients admitted to given hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk adjustment: &lt;/b&gt;Risk adjustment is a statistical process that adjusts a hospital\&amp;#146;s estimated performance if the hospital had an "average" case mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confidence interval: &lt;/b&gt;The confidence interval tells us we can be reasonably "confident" (in this case, 95% confident) that a hospital\&amp;#146;s rate fell somewhere within this specified range. The lower and upper bounds represent the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the confidence interval.  The smaller the range, the more precise the estimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information to help you interpret the statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ratio of observed/expected rate: &lt;/b&gt;Observed rate divided by expected rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the observed rate is greater than the expected rate (i.e., the ratio of observed/expected is greater than 1.0, or observed minus expected is positive), the hospital performed worse than the reference population for that particular indicator.

For more information on which statistics are available for each indicator, visit the <a class="local-link" href="#/resources/AboutQualityRatings" >Measure Details</a> page. Numbers in the measure details table are not scaled.  These are raw statistics.<br/><br/><b>Numerator: </b>The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest occurs (e.g., death caused by heart attack).<br/><br/><b>Denominator: </b>The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest might potentially occur (e.g., admitted to the hospital for heart attack).<br/><br/><b>Observed rate: </b>The numerator divided by the denominator. This rate is unadjusted.<br/><br/><b>Expected rate: </b>The rate the hospital would have if it performed the same as the reference population given the hospital\&#146;s actual case mix. In other words, the expected rate adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, DRG, and comorbidity categories) among patients admitted to given hospitals.<br/><br/><b>Risk adjustment: </b>Risk adjustment is a statistical process that adjusts a hospital\&#146;s estimated performance if the hospital had an "average" case mix.<br/><br/><b>Confidence interval: </b>The confidence interval tells us we can be reasonably "confident" (in this case, 95% confident) that a hospital\&#146;s rate fell somewhere within this specified range. The lower and upper bounds represent the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the confidence interval.

Numbers in the measure details table are not scaled.  These are raw statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Numerator: &lt;/b&gt;The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest occurs (e.g., death caused by heart attack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Denominator: &lt;/b&gt;The number of hospital stays in which the event or outcome of interest might potentially occur (e.g., admitted to the hospital for heart attack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observed rate: &lt;/b&gt;The numerator divided by the denominator. This rate is unadjusted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected rate: &lt;/b&gt;The rate the hospital would have if it performed the same as the reference population given the hospital\&amp;#146;s actual case mix. In other words, the expected rate adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, DRG, and comorbidity categories) among patients admitted to given hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk adjustment: &lt;/b&gt;Risk adjustment is a statistical process that adjusts a hospital\&amp;#146;s estimated performance if the hospital had an "average" case mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confidence interval: &lt;/b&gt;The confidence interval tells us we can be reasonably "confident" (in this case, 95% confident) that a hospital\&amp;#146;s rate fell somewhere within this specified range. The lower and upper bounds represent the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the confidence interval.  The smaller the range, the more precise the estimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information to help you interpret the statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ratio of observed/expected rate: &lt;/b&gt;Observed rate divided by expected rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the observed rate is greater than the expected rate (i.e., the ratio of observed/expected is greater than 1.0, or observed minus expected is positive), the hospital performed worse than the reference population for that particular indicator. Users may want to focus on these indicators for quality improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the observed rate is less than the expected rate (i.e., the ratio of observed/expected is less than 1.0, or observed minus expected is negative), then the implication is that the hospital performed better than the reference population. Users may want to focus on these indicators for identifying best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of patients: &lt;/b&gt;When hospitals treat a very large number of patients, chance differences will not have much effect on the overall rates. The range will be small and the estimated rates will be more precise. In hospitals that treat smaller numbers of patients, however, even small chance differences could have a big impact on rates. The 95% confidence interval will be large, and the estimated rates will be much less precise. Because the number of patients treated at U.S. hospitals varies widely, the precision of hospitals\&amp;#146; estimated rates also varies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small number suppression: &lt;/b&gt;Small raw numbers may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality.

&lt;p&gt;Medicare Provider Charge Data (Inpatient). These include hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients and these charges are the amount the hospital bills for an item or service. The Total Payment amount includes the MS-DRG amount, bill total per diem, beneficiary primary payer claim payment amount, beneficiary Part A coinsurance amount, beneficiary deductible amount, beneficiary blood deducible amount and DRG outlier amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these DRGs, average charges, average total payments, and average Medicare payments are calculated at the individual hospital level. Users will be able to make comparisons between the amount charged by individual hospitals within local markets, and nationwide, for services that might be furnished in connection with a particular inpatient stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest data file can be downloaded from the MONAHRQ website under the &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; section. It is available in CSV format at http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of discharges (principal):&lt;/strong&gt; The number of hospital stays (or discharges) for the selected DRG is provided for a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean charges in dollars:&lt;/strong&gt; Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients and these charges are the amount the hospital bills for an item or service. This does not include professional (MD) fees. Charges are not necessarily how much was paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean costs in dollars:&lt;/strong&gt; The average cost is sometimes reported for each hospital. Costs are the actual value of services performed (while charges represent the amount the hospital asked to be paid for services). Total charges were converted to costs using cost-to-charge ratios based on hospital accounting reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In general, costs are less than charges. AHRQ adjusts the cost-to-charge ratios to work with this type of hospital data.&lt;/p&gt;

Principal diagnosis means this is the condition chiefly responsible for admission to the hospital for care.  The principal procedure is the procedure that was done to address the principal diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mean charges in dollars: &lt;/b&gt;The mean or average charge is sometimes reported for each hospital.

    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The information on this website comes from two sources:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;1. Yearly health and safety inspections of each nursing home that are done by state agencies. Health and safety information, and staffing information, come from reports on these inspections.
    &lt;br&gt;2. Monthly information that each nursing home submits to the federal government about each resident. Quality information comes from this information source.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s here?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;There are three types of information in this Report:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as whether residents are receiving appropriate care what is happening to their health and ability to function&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and Safety Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as number of health and safety problems found when state agencies did an inspection&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the number of nursing home staff available to care for residents during their stay&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;This information helps you compare nursing homes to each other and see which are better. You can compare up to 5 nursing homes in terms of their Overall Score, their Inspection Score, their Quality Score and their Staffing Score.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I use this information?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;You can use this information to:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;help you choose a nursing home for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;provide useful information for your loved ones if they need nursing home care&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Residents in Certified Beds:&lt;/strong&gt; Certified beds are beds in the nursing home that have been approved by the federal government.&amp;nbsp; When a nursing home has fewer residents in beds than the number of certified beds, they should have room for new residents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provider Type:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether the nursing home participates in the federal Medicare program, the Medicaid program, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the nursing home located in a hospital?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the nursing home located in a continuing care retirement community?&lt;/strong&gt; A continuing care retirement community is a place that offers different levels of care for older people, including independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Focus Facility:&lt;/strong&gt; Special Focus Facilities (SFF) are nursing homes that have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More health and safety problems&lt;/strong&gt; than other nursing homes (about twice the average number of deficiencies),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More serious problems&lt;/strong&gt; than most other nursing homes (including harm or injury experienced by residents), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pattern of serious problems&lt;/strong&gt;that has continued &lt;strong&gt;over a long time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government requires that Special Focus nursing homes be inspected twice as often&amp;nbsp; as other nursing homes (about twice per year). These visits are used to see whether the nursing home has improved the identified problems or is in need of disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the nursing home have a resident and family council?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Resident and Family Councils are organized groups of nursing home residents, or their family members, who meet to share ideas and concerns that matter to patients. Under federal law, all nursing home residents and their families have the right to form a council and hold regular meetings.

    &lt;br&gt;Each rating in the report is shown as a simple image along with a word or two. The words will tell you how a particular nursing home compares to the average rating of the other homes in the area. Going from best to worst, the rating will show that a nursing home is:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"&gt;&lt;span class="rating-nursing"&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The information on this website comes from two sources:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;1. Yearly health and safety inspections of each nursing home that are done by state agencies. Health and safety information, and staffing information, come from reports on these inspections.
    &lt;br&gt;2. Monthly information that each nursing home submits to the federal government about each resident. Quality information comes from this information source.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s here?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;There are three types of information in this Report:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as whether residents are receiving appropriate care what is happening to their health and ability to function&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and Safety Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as number of health and safety problems found when state agencies did an inspection&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing Information&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the number of nursing home staff available to care for residents during their stay&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;This information helps you compare nursing homes to each other and see which are better. You can compare up to 5 nursing homes in terms of their Overall Score, their Inspection Score, their Quality Score and their Staffing Score.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I use this information?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;You can use this information to:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;help you choose a nursing home for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;provide useful information for your loved ones if they need nursing home care&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;encourage nursing homes to improve their quality&lt;/li&gt;
